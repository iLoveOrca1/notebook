When you're having a bad day just imagine a black cloud. It was there but soon it will float away.

Now when you're having an extremely happy day, just image a white cloud. It is beautiful but it also will float away.

Only when we let all of those cloud float and drift, we can finally see the beautiful blue sky beneath those black and white clouds. That are true happines
