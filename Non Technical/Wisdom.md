some wisdom that I learned throughout my life

> _" Life was boring, you don't need any big movement to become a great person you just have to be more boring than everybody else. "_

> _"Your mind was a fat liar. When your mind was saying that you're done you are actually at 40% of what you're actually capable of"_

> _"Don't rush, and don't do nothing either. Life is a marathon not a sprint."_

> _"No matter how hard you try, if your goal is validation then your hard work will be useless."_

> _"Our vision was short. Don't try to see too far ahead. Focus on the thing that is important now. Focus on the 'Now'."_

> _"What are you going to be in 5 years defined on what are you doing yesterday when no one is looking."_
