# **Hack The Box - Learning Process**
Just my note on the Learning Process module in HackTheBox 

## **Section 1. The Mindset**
### **_1.1. Way of Thinking._**
We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

- The Principle of Abstraction.
- The Principle of Correspondence.
- The Principle of Data Type Completeness.

### **_1.2. Occam's Razor._**

- The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

-   **_" The art, after all, is not to get some flag but to find the way to do it._**

### **_1.3. Talent_**
No one is born talented but continuing learning leads us to the place where we are more acknowledged than yesterday, so keep learning, learning is a journey…

## **Section 2. Learning Dependencies**

### **_2.1. Way of Learning.**

``` 
Q. 20 * ____ + _____ = 65535 
```

For the above-given equation multiple ways to solve it, so we should think outside the box. “Think Outside the Box”. We shouldn't limit our thoughts for a particular subject matter.

- A problem is an **emotional** state. Without emotions, it is just a **situation.**
- Know your goal

### **_2.2. Learning Efficiency_**

The primary and most difficult objective is to overcome it by combining our **knowledge**, **adaptation**, and **new information.**

Finding the information we need is often challenging. First, we have to determine what kind of information we need.

- What do we already know?
- What do we not know yet?

```
"What does it mean to be good?"
```

To be good at something means we know **what we are doing.** 

### **_2.3. Learning Type_**

![Learning Pyramid](learningPyramid.jpg "Learning Pyramid")

- There are two types of learning. That are:

    - **Pasive Learning**: If we follow the Learning Pyramid while going through the modules just by reading, we will learn only about **10%** of the whole penetration testing experience. By watching some demonstrations, we will not learn more than **30%.**

    - **Active Learning**: By discussing our entire enumeration process, results, and findings with others, we will see different points of view, results, and information to compare with our own and find out what we missed. That alone will add up to **50%** of the experience. While we practice, our learning experience grows up to **75%.**

- Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.

### **_2.4. The Brain_**
Here are a few **myths** about the brain:

- We use only **5-10%** of our brainpower. 
- How **fast** we learn something says how **intelligent** we are.
- **Einstein**, who we know was **terrible at math** and learned very **slowly** throughout his school career, unlike the others.

*What Are Thoughts?*

- A thought is an **individual process** (action/reaction) to one or more **influences** (internal/external) in which information is **interpreted and linked** inwardly according to our **personal methodology** (developed through our existing lifetimes).

Conscious Thought

- **Consciousness** describes the totality of all those **mental processes** by which we become **aware** of the **external and our internal world** with **active observation.** Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looking at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and **intentionally look** elsewhere, we are in consciousness.

Unconscious Thoughts

- Emotions **reflect** the way we think subconsciously.
- We process **far more thoughts** subconsciously than consciously.
- **Among other things**, the subconscious mind has **already made a decision 30 seconds** before we become **aware** of it.

``` 
Fun fact, most people do not even know that the brain regions responsible for the most difficult logical tasks do not develop until we're 20 (+/- 2) years old. 
```

### **_2.5. The Will_**

From a philosophical point of view, will is defined as **deciding** on a particular type of action based on the **motives** for acting consciously. So let us say will is the **effort** to perform a certain **action** or **achieve a specific goal.** Therefore, it is most relevant for us to have decided to achieve a goal that we have determined and strive for it.

Unfortunately, most people stop dreaming shortly after they start because they do not see a way to get there. These people overlook the essential component that **the path plays absolutely no role in how we reach that goal** because, ultimately, our path is only created by the steps we take.

```
But... What are fear?
```

- Fear is a **state and the product** of our **imagination** of the future and its consequences **where the present is suppressed.**

So let's ask if this fear is called for:

- Have we already worked through all the material?
- Have we already seen what is being taught and how it is being taught?
- Do we already have to have the skills that are expected of us?

If we answer "no" to these three questions, it should be clear that we are afraid of something without even trying it.

### **_2.6. The Goal_**

Over 90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting **challenging and specific goals.** We cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of setting a clear goal for ourselves. Try to ask yourself: 

What do we want to achieve? Do we want to...:

- Pass an exam?
- Obtain a certification?
- Learn and master new skills?
- Or impress and please others?

Because the decision of what goal we want to achieve influences how we learn, **a task or goal helps us influence how we think.** This is because naturally, we subconsciously will pick the easiest path to achieve our goal. Be note that:

- Want to complete the module and
- Want to understand or master the module

will give us a different results.

An essential part of this is that by avoiding our own "thinking" (in the other word not trying to solve the task on our own), we deprive ourselves of the possibility of creating chains of associations in our brain. Thus, in simple terms, by avoiding our own "thinking" we deprive ourselves of the ability to learn something new and to develop further.

```
Just like a switch, efficiency WILL conflicts with comfort.
```

### **_2.7. Decision Making_**

#### 2.7.1 The Trolley Problem.

"A train speeds unbraked toward a group of five-track workers. The switchman might divert the train to a siding where only one person is working. Should he sacrifice one person to save five others?"

![Trolley Problem](trolleyProblem.png "Trolley Problem")

Here, at first sight we only two options:

- either we switch tracks, and the train runs over one person.
- or we do nothing (we will not be guilty by doing nothing right?), and five people are run over by the train.

Let's consider the following solution to the trolley problem:

![Trolley Problem Solved](trolleyProblemSolved.png "Trolley Problem Solved")

The red lines represent ropes, and the blue circles represent pillars that we have placed. The first thing that comes to mind is:

- "But we are not allowed to place pillars" or.
- "We are only allowed to press the switch."

Afterall, the fact is that no one has told us whether we are allowed to move or not. **We set our limitations ourselves, not by others.** However, if we learn to set these limits based on facts, our decisions will be much easier and, above all, much more effective.

If we take a closer look at the trolley problem, the first questions arise:

- How far away is the train?
- How fast is the train going?
- How much time do we have to try to save everyone?
- How can we save everyone?
- What tools do we have at our disposal?

Decide (**Decision Making**) on the goal defined in detail (**The Goal**) that you really want to achieve from your heart (**Willingness**), and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously (**The Brain**).

## **Section 3. The Learning Overview**

### **_3.1. Documentation_**

Here are some essential characteristics of documentation are:

- Overview
- Structure
- Clarity

There are many resources available for documentation. We recommend a tool called **CherryTree.**

=> No matter whom the documentation is intended for, here are some guidelines we can follow:

- It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
- Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
- Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

### **_3.2. Organization_**

=> It may take us a single day to take over several systems. So we don't want to keep looking for sources or information we need over and over again. Organization is best described in the following example:

- An **inexperienced** woodcutter takes **30 minutes** to sharpen his axe and **3 hours** to cut down the tree.
- The **experienced** one will sharpen the axe for **3 hours** and cut down the tree within **30 minutes.**

There are many different management techniques and methods that we can use.These include:

- Scrum
- Agile
- ToDo-Lists
- Bullet Journal and more.

## **Section 4. The Process**

### **_4.1. What Are Focus?_**

It is essential to differentiate between **focus** and **attention** because they are not the same. 

- **Attention** refers to **the momentum,** as it is happening right now, and you are reading this text.
-  However, the **focus** is on the **topic** you are dealing with at the moment.

The **focus** is based on our **will** and what we want to achieve. It can be a **conscious** decision and a **subconscious** decision guided by external influences.

- **Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.**

Focused people are not only enormously persistent and tenacious, but they are also hardly distracted or discouraged. If we know our goal, it is easier to align our focus accordingly. This, in turn, makes us much more efficient, and we get closer to our goal much faster and do not let ourselves be distracted by external influences.

### **_4.2. Attention**

=> *It can be said that attention is the perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest in order to gather specific data and information from it.*

- **Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.**

Attention is an independent mental process that takes place **subconsciously.** So when we talk about **concentration,** we mean the maintenance of our attention on a specific topic. Keep in mind that our attention changes with our experience and the information we gain from the content and its clarity.
### **_4.3. Comfort_**

#### **Yerkes-Dodson**

![Yerkes-Dodson](newYerkesDodsonLaw.png "The Yerkes Dodson Law")

When we leave the so-called **comfort zone,** we enter a situation or field where we have little or no experience. This kind of uncertainty lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which, in turn, slows us down.

The fact that small children do not exhibit such uncertainty is interesting.

- **They love to try out something new all the time and are not afraid or uncertain of making mistakes.**

After all, **mistakes are an essential part of the learning process,** and we should always keep it in mind.

An interesting question that arises here is: "Why small children, unlike adults, do not feel such uncertainty?"

![Comfort Zone](theComfortZone.png "Comfort Zone")

Those who chose to leave the comfort zone would reach their destination faster than they thought they would. They would never have sprinted at such speed before in their lives.

### **_4.4. Obstacle_**

#### _The Fear_

Imaginary fear is directed at events we imagine with consequences that we calculate. However, there is one crucial aspect that we cannot leave out:

- **People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.**

Fear in non-life-threatening situations lies in the thoughts of the 'imaginary' future. In a future that we imagine and imagine ourselves. The more detailed we imagine it, the greater the fear becomes. Will Smith has also reported his experience with the confrontation with his fear.

https://youtu.be/VsTBCQ2MnRM

However, if we find ourselves feeling such fear, then we should answer the following question in as much detail as possible:

-  "Which of the mentioned reasons are actually real right now?"

Another factor that reinforces this imaginary fear and makes us think we will fail is our previous failures. One thing we should remember in advance, write it down and hang it on the wall where we can always see it:

```
The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser.
```

=> Failure is essential to learning and unavoidable. No one has ever acquired a skill without making a single mistake. It is quite the opposite. 

#### _Mindset_

It is in these situations that our excuses come up, like:

- I cannot do this
- This is not for me
- I do not understand this
- etc.

The only thing we have to do is to add the word "yet."

- I cannot do this **"yet."**
- This is not for me **"yet."**
- I do not understand this **"yet."**
- etc.

This has the effect of stimulating our beliefs and thus the mindset to pass this obstacle.

Another factor often perceived as an obstacle is comparing skill, talent, and passion. However, we have already learned what constitutes talent.

- Talent is a strongly developed skill with high efficiency.
- Skill is the ability to manage or solve something well.
- Passion is an emotional commitment to a particular area.

```
"Yes, not everyone can be a great hacker, but a great hacker can comes from everyone"
```

#### _Pressure_

If we find ourselves in a situation where we do not know what to do, we can pursue some activity requiring us to do something new. It does not matter what we do, but rather that it requires our creativity.

It is good to know that we only feel verbally attacked by people we attribute a high value to is essential. For example, there is a big difference between a stranger on the street calling us an "idiot" and one of our loved ones. So if we think highly of the person or their abilities, we will value their statements highly and often even place them above our own opinions. Otherwise, we care little about what that person says.

We can eliminate external influences more easily than many might think. All we need is our clearly defined goal. If we have such a goal that we follow passionately, hardly anyone will talk us out of it. It is even less likely if we know that we can achieve this goal.

We should remember the following:

- Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions. Everything else is only assumptions.

### **_4.5 Questioning_**

Especially in our field of cyber security and above all in penetration testing, we should keep the following in mind:

- **The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.**
