# **Top 10 Habit of a Hacker**

# _FIND A WAY, OR MAKE ONE_

#1. Start Hacking, Take Action

Don't wait for the perfect time to come out, guess what it will never. It is okay if you want to have something but don't do nothing just because you don't have the thing. Take action, start virtual lab. Try hackthebox, tryhackme. Try online live ctf competition. Start bugbounty? Why not?

#2. Think Like and Explorer, Not a User

Don't just use technology the way it was meant to be. Hackers think like an explorer. Have a webpage? Try look at the source code. Have an endpoint? Try poke some parameter. Got an executable? Why not decompile and play with the input.  

- Explore it.
- Question it.
- Break it apart.

Hackers are digital explorer.
